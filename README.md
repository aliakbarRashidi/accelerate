# Initializer

Initializer helps you read a set of related objects (object graph) from several xml files or annotated interfaces. The goal is to write these xml files or annotated interfaces with minimum effort and with intutive structure and easy object referencing and left the hard work of reading them to Initializer. The project can be used to initialize (populate) your database with your JPA entities or read a complex configuration file. 

The main advantages of this project, over other currently available approches is in its easy but flexible mechanism for object referencing, unification of xml-based and nnotation-based description of object graph, and support of default values..
