Accelerate
==========

Aims to accelerate development of JSF-CDI-JPA based projects.

# Initializer

Initializer helps you read a set of related objects (object graph) from several xml files or annotated interfaces. The goal is to write these xml files or annotated interfaces with minimum effort and with intutive structure and easy object referencing and left the hard work of reading them to Initializer.
The main advantages of this project, over other currently available approches is in its easy but flexible mechanism for object referencing and unification of xml-based and annotation-based description of object graph.
The project can be used to populate your database with your jpa entities or read a complex configuration file.
